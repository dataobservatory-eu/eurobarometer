     Because `eurobarometer` is in an early development phase, you cannot install it
         from CRAN with the `install.packages("eurobarometer")` command yet.
         You can install the development version of `eurobarometer` from
         [GitHub](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/eurobarometer)
         with `devtools`.

      The human peer-review of output from many surveys is very difficult due to
          the high dimensionality of the harmonized survey datasets. We would
          like to support review with several forms of unit testing and automation.
